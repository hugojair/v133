booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track

abstract: 'The clinical  time-series setting  poses  a  unique  combination  of  challenges  to  data  modelling  and  sharing.   Due  to  the  high  dimensionality  of  clinical  time  series,  adequate  de-identification
  to preserve privacy while retaining data utility is difficult to achieve using common
  de-identification techniques.  An innovative approach to this problem is synthetic
  data  generation.   From  a  technical  perspective,  a  good  generative  model  for  time-series
  data should preserve temporal dynamics; new sequences should respect the original
  relationships between high-dimensional variables across time.  From the privacy
  perspective, the model should prevent patient re-identification.  The NeurIPS 2020
  Hide-and-Seek Privacy Challenge was a novel two-tracked competition to simultaneously
  accelerate progress in tackling both problems.  In our head-to-head format, participants
  in the generation track (?hiders?) and the patient re-identification track (?seekers?)
  were directly pitted against each other by way of a new, high-quality intensive
  care time-series dataset:  the AmsterdamUMCdb dataset.  In this paper we present
  an overview of the competition design, as well as highlighting areas we feel should
  be changed for future iterations of this competition.'
