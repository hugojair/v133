abstract: 'Power networks, responsible for transporting electricity across large geographical
  regions, are complex infrastructures on which modern life critically depend. Variations
  in demand and production profiles, with increasing renewable energy integration,
  as well as the high voltage network technology, constitute a real challenge for
  human operators when optimizing electricity transportation while avoiding blackouts.
  Motivated to  investigate the potential of Artificial Intelligence methods in enabling
  adaptability in power network operation, we have designed a L2RPN challenge to encourage
  the development of reinforcement learning solutions to key problems present in the
  next-generation power networks. The NeurIPS 2020 competition was well received by
  the international community attracting over 300 participants worldwide.   The main
  contribution of this challenge is our proposed comprehensive ’Grid2Op’ framework,
  and associated benchmark, which plays realistic sequential network operations scenarios.
  The Grid2Op framework, which is open-source and easily re-usable, allows users  to
  define new environments with its companion GridAlive ecosystem. Grid2Op relies on
  existing non-linear physical power network simulators and let users create a series
  of perturbations and challenges that are representative of two important problems:
  a) the uncertainty resulting from the increased use of unpredictable renewable energy
  sources, and b) the robustness required with contingent line disconnections.  In
  this paper, we give the highlights of the NeurIPS 2020 competition. We present the
  benchmark suite and analyse the winning solutions, including one super-human performance
  demonstration. We propose our organizational insights for a successful competition
  and conclude on open research avenues. Given the challenge success, we expect our
  work will foster research to create more sustainable solutions for power network
  operations. '
