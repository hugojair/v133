abstract: Building footprints provide a useful proxy for a great many humanitarian
  applications.  For example, building footprints are useful for high fidelity population
  estimates, and quantifying population statistics is fundamental to  1/4 of the United
  Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators.  In this paper we (the SpaceNet
  Partners) discuss efforts to develop techniques for precise building footprint localization,
  tracking, and change detection via the SpaceNet Multi-Temporal Urban Development
  Challenge (also known as SpaceNet 7).  In this NeurIPS 2020 competition, participants
  were asked identify and track buildings in satellite imagery time series collected
  over rapidly urbanizing areas. The competition centered around a brand new open
  source dataset of Planet Labs satellite imagery mosaics at 4m resolution, which
  includes 24 images (one per month) covering  100 unique geographies. Tracking individual
  buildings at this resolution is quite challenging, yet the winning participants
  demonstrated impressive performance with the newly developed SpaceNet Change and
  Object Tracking (SCOT) metric.  This paper details the top-5 winning approaches,
  as well as analysis of results that yielded a handful of interesting anecdotes such
  as decreasing performance with latitude.
