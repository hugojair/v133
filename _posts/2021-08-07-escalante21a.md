abstract: 'This volume compiles a selection of papers associated with the fourth edition
  of the Demonstration and Competition Track at NeurIPS 2020. The track comprised  16
  competitions and 20 demonstrations. Competition and demonstration proposals were
  subject to a strict reviewing process to ensure the quality of the accepted events.
  After a selective process, the accepted  competitions and demonstrations were featured
  at the NeurIPS 2020 main conference. A wide diversity of machine learning topics
  were covered with competitions and demonstrations. The latter included innovative
  ways of interacting with participants due to the virtual format of NeurIPS2020. '
