abstract: 'We review the EfficientQA competition from NeurIPS 2020. The competition
  focused on open-domain question answering (QA), where systems take natural language
  questions as input and return natural language answers.  The aim of the competition
  was to build systems that can predict correct answers while also satisfying strict
  on-disk memory budgets. These memory budgets were designed to encourage contestants
  to  explore  the  trade-off between storing retrieval corpora or the parameters
  of learned models. In this report, we describe the motivation and organization of
  the competition, review the best submissions, and analyze system predictions to
  inform a discussion of evaluation for open-domain QA. '
