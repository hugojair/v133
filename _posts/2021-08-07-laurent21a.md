abstract: "The Flatland competition aimed at finding novel approaches to solve the
  vehicle re-scheduling problem (VRSP). The VRSP is concerned with scheduling trips
  in traffic networks and the re-scheduling of vehicles when disruptions occur, for
  example the breakdown of a vehicle. While solving the VRSP in various settings has
  been an active area in operations research (OR) for decades, the ever-growing complexity
  of modern railway networks makes dynamic real-time scheduling of traffic virtually
  impossible. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has successfully
  tackled challenging tasks where many agents need to be coordinated, such as multiplayer
  video games. However, the coordination of hundreds of agents in a real-life setting
  like a railway network remains challenging and the Flatland environment used for
  the competition models these real-world properties in a simplified manner. Submissions
  had to bring as many trains (agents) to their target stations in as little time
  as possible. While the best submissions were in the OR category, participants found
  many promising MARL approaches. Using both centralized and decentralized learning
  based approaches, top submissions used graph representations of the environment
  to construct tree-based observations. Further, different coordination mechanisms
  were implemented, such as communication and prioritization between agents. This
  paper presents the competition setup, four outstanding solutions to the competition,
  and a cross-comparison between them.\t"
