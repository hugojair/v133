abstract: 'A major bottleneck of the current Machine Learning (ML) workflow is the
  time consuming, error prone engineering required to get data from a datastore or
  a database (DB) to the point an ML algorithm can be applied to it.  This is further
  exacerbated since ML algorithms are now trained on large volumes of data, yet we
  need predictions in real-time, especially in a variety of time-series applications
  such as finance and real-time control systems.  Hence, we explore the feasibility
  of directly integrating prediction functionality on top of a data store or DB.  Such
  a system ideally:  (i) provides an intuitive prediction query interface which alleviates
  the unwieldy data engineering;  (ii) provides state-of-the-art statistical accuracy
  while ensuring incremental model update, low model training time  and low latency
  for making predictions.  As the main contribution we explicitly instantiate a proof-of-concept,
  tspDB which directly integrates with PostgreSQL.  We rigorously test tspDB’s statistical
  and computational performance against the state-of-the-art time series algorithms,
  including a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural network and DeepAR (industry standard
  deep learning library by Amazon).  Statistically, on standard time series benchmarks,
  tspDB outperforms LSTM and DeepAR with 1.1-1.3x higher relative accuracy.  Computationally,
  tspDB is 59-62x and 94-95x faster compared to LSTM and DeepAR in terms of median
  ML model training time and prediction query latency, respectively.  Further, compared
  to PostgreSQL’s bulk insert time and its SELECT query latency, tspDB is slower only
  by 1.3x and 2.6x respectively.  That is, tspDB is a real-time prediction system
  in that its model training / prediction query time is similar to just inserting,
  reading data from a DB. As an algorithmic contribution, we introduce an incremental
  multivariate matrix factorization based time series method, which tspDB is built
  off. We show this method also allows one to produce reliable prediction intervals
  by accurately estimating the time-varying variance of a time series, thereby addressing
  an important problem in time series analysis.'
