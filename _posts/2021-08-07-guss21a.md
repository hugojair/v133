abstract: 'Reinforcement learning competitions have formed the basis for standard
  research benchmarks, galvanized advances in the state-of-the-art, and shaped the
  direction of the field. Despite this, a majority of challenges suffer from the same
  fundamental problems: participant solutions to the posed challenge are usually domain-specific,
  biased to maximally exploit compute resources, and not guaranteed to be reproducible.
  In this paper, we present a new framework of competition design that promotes the
  development of algorithms that overcome these barriers. We propose four central
  mechanisms for achieving this end: submission retraining, domain randomization,
  desemantization through domain obfuscation, and the limitation of competition compute
  and environment-sample budget. To demonstrate the efficacy of this design, we proposed,
  organized, and ran the MineRL 2020 Competition on Sample-Efficient Reinforcement
  Learning. In this work, we describe the organizational outcomes of the competition
  and show that the resulting participant submissions are reproducible, non-specific
  to the competition environment, and sample/resource efficient, despite the difficult
  competition task.'
