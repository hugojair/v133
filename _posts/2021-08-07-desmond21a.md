title: Semi-Automated Data Labeling
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track
year: '2021'
abstract: 'Labeling data is often a tedious and error-prone activity. However, organizing
  the labeling experience as a human-machine collaboration has the potential to improve
  label quality and reduce human effort. In this paper we describe a semi-automated
  data labeling system which employs a predictive model to guide and assist the human
  labeler. The model learns by observing labeling decisions, and is used to recommend
  labels and automate basic functions in the labeling interface. Agreement between
  the labeler and the model is tracked and presented via a system of checkpoints.
  At each checkpoint the labeler has the opportunity to delegate the remainder of
  the labeling task to the model. '
