  for Local Bayesian Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track
year: '2021'
abstract: Black-box optimization is one of the vital tasks in machine learning, since
  it approximates real-world conditions, in that we do not always know all the properties
  of a given system, up to knowing almost nothing but the results. This paper describes
  our approach to solving the black-box optimization challenge at NeurIPS 2020 through
  learning search space partition for local Bayesian optimization. We describe the
  task of the challenge as well as our algorithm for low budget optimization that
  we named SPBOpt. We optimize the hyper-parameters of our algorithm for the competition
  finals using multi-task Bayesian optimization on results from the first two evaluation
  settings. Our approach has ranked third in the competition finals.
