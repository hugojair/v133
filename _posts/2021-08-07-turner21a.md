title: 'Bayesian Optimization is Superior to Random Search for Machine Learning Hyperparameter
  Tuning: Analysis of the Black-Box Optimization Challenge 2020'

abstract: This paper presents the results and insights from the black-box optimization
  (BBO) challenge at NeurIPS2020 which ran from Julyâ€“October, 2020. The challenge
  emphasized the importance of evaluating derivative-free optimizers for tuning the
  hyperparameters of machine learning models. This was the first black-box optimization
  challenge with a machine learning emphasis. It was based on tuning (validation set)
  performance of standard machine learning models on real datasets. This competition
  has widespread impact as black-box optimization (e.g., Bayesian optimization) is
  relevant for hyperparameter tuning in almost every machine learning project as well
  as many applications outside of machine learning. The final leaderboard was determined
  using the optimization performance on held-out (hidden) objective functions, where
  the optimizers ran without human intervention. Baselines were set using the default
  settings of several open source black-box optimization packages as well as random
  search.
