title: 'Musical Speech: A Transformer-based Composition Tool'
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track

abstract: In this paper, we propose a new compositional tool that will generate a
  musical outline of speech recorded/provided by the user for use as a musical building
  block in their compositions. The tool allows any user to use their own speech to
  generate musical material, while still being able to hear the direct connection
  between their recorded speech and the resulting music. The tool is built on our
  proposed pipeline. This pipeline begins with speech-based signal processing, after
  which some simple musical heuristics are applied, and finally these pre-processed
  signals are passed through Transformer models trained on new musical tasks. We illustrate
  the effectiveness of our pipeline – which does not require a paired dataset for
  training – through examples of music created by musicians making use of our tool.
